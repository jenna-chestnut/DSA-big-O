// Solve the drills 1 - 7 from your previous checkpoint (Recursion) iteratively. 

// 1. Counting Sheep

// Write a recursive function that counts how many sheep jump over the fence. 
// Your program should take a number as input. That number should be the number of sheep you have. 
// The function should display the number along with the message "Another sheep jumps over the fence" until no more sheep are left.

//     Input: 3
//     Output:
//         3: Another sheep jumps over the fence
//         2: Another sheep jumps over the fence
//         1: Another sheep jumps over the fence
//         All sheep jumped over the fence



// 2. Power Calculator

// Write a function called powerCalculator() that takes two parameters, an integer as a base, and another integer as an exponent. 
// The function returns the value of the base raised to the power of the exponent. 
// Use only exponents greater than or equal to 0 (positive numbers)

//     powerCalculator(10,2) should return 100
//     powerCalculator(10,-2) should return exponent should be >= 0


// 3. Reverse String

// Write a function that reverses a string. Take a string as input, reverse the string, and return the new string.


// 4. nth Triangular Number

// Calculate the nth triangular number. 
// A triangular number counts the objects that can form an equilateral triangle. 
// The nth triangular number is the number of dots composing a triangle with n dots on a side, and is equal to the sum of the n natural numbers from 1 to n. 
// This is the Triangular Number Sequence: 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45.


// 5. String Splitter

// Write a recursive function that splits a string based on a separator (similar to String.prototype.split). 
// Don't use JS array's split function to solve this problem.

//     Input: 02/20/2020
//     Output: ["02", "20", "2020"]


// 6. Fibonacci

// Write a recursive function that prints the Fibonacci sequence of a given number. 
// The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the 2 preceding numbers. 
// For example, the 7th Fibonacci number in a Fibonacci sequence is 13. The sequence looks as follows: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13.


// 7. Factorial

// Write a recursive function that finds the factorial of a given number. 
// The factorial of a number can be found by multiplying that number by each number between itself and 1. 
// For example, the factorial of 5 is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.
